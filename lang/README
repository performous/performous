Translation guide
=================

We recommend using POEdit (http://www.poedit.net/)
For Windows, download it from the website.
Most Linux distros have it in their repositories.

NOTE: Don't generate the binary .mo files - they are
      compiled (and installed) with Performous build

Updating existing translations
------------------------------
  1. Open the .po file in POEdit.
  2. Hit the Synchronize to source button in the toolbar.
  3. Start translating.
  4. Remember to save.

NOTES:
  * Setup your name and email in POEdit preferences if you haven't used it before
  * Also setup the Performous XML parser as instructed below
  * POEdit C/C++ parser might not recognize .hh extension by default, so add that:
    Edit -> Preferences -> Parsers -> C/C++ -> Edit -> List of extensions

Configuring the Performous XML parser
-------------------------------------
These steps enable translation of the XML locate bits.
  1. Click Edit -> Preferences
  2. Click the Parsers tab
  3. Click the New button and fill out the form like this:
       Language: Performous XML
       List of extensions: *.xml
       Parser command: $SOURCE_ROOT/tools/scripts/xml_gettext.sh %o %F
       An item in keywords list:
       An item in input files list: %f
       Source code charset:
     Where $SOURCE_ROOT is the path to the performous sources root.
  4. Click Okay

Creating a new catalog
----------------------
These are the steps to create a new catalog, but easiest
is probably just copy one of the existing ones and start
from there (in which case you can skip these steps.)

   1. Start POEdit
   2. Click File -> New Catalog
   3. Enter a project name (performous)
   4. Click the Paths tab at the top
   5. Click the New Item icon (second one, looks like a little square)
   6. Enter the path to the directory containing your plug-in file ("." tells POEdit to scan the directory that you will save the file to, usually only need to include ../game and ../data), press enter
   7. Click the Keywords tab at the top
   8. Click the New Item icon
   9. Enter _ (that's underscore), press enter
  10. Enter translate_noop and press enter
  11. Click Okay
  12. Choose a name for your .po file (performous) 
  13. Follow the instructions above to enable XML translation

REMEMBER TO SAVE WITH YOU LOCALE NAME

Example for English:
en.po
