# Language based grouping

This folder groups each song by the language or comma seperated languages. This is an easy way to sort songs.

## Instructions

Each image in this folder corresponds to the language(s) of the songs. For example, if a song is in English, the corresponding image would be `English.jpg`.

You can also use SVG files instead of JPG files. In these cases, the SVG file will be embedded into the page.
