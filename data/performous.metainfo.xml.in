      <description>The past couple of months the focus was to ease the life of developers.

In between the discussing a couple of bugs and new features were also fixed and added.

# Notes

On Windows you might want to enable UTF-8 support throughout the system. This way windows can support special characters within song paths. You can enable this by doing this:

1. Windows btn + R -&gt; intl.cpl
2. Hit the 2nd tab called "administritive"
3. Hit the button "Change System Locale..."
4. Tick the checkbox "Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support"
5. Restart pc</description>

    <release version="1.2.0" date="2022-03-27" type="stable">
      <description>Now for real an official new version where we patched a couple of things from the rc1 version.

It's been quite some time we've made a release (almost 6 years). Within this release we've mainly stabilized Performous and focused on automation and solving bugs.
However there are also a few new features within this release!

# Upcoming releases

We've made some big gains in automation. This is why we're going to change the releasing strategy.
With the upcoming release we'll have a release candidate. A release candidate will be a branch on its own (with a tag) where only hotfixes will be applied to.
After a succesful testing period we'll then make a release. If the testing period is not succesful we'll create a new release candidate and repeat the testing.
Once a release candidate is ready we'll make a release branch and tag that branch as the official release.

We'll try to create more releases in less time. Preferably after every PR. As we always did we will use semver as version strategy.

    <release version="1.1" date="2016-01-23" type="stable">
      <description>This is mostly a bugfix release. But there are some small new features as well:
- You can now enable a "center channel suppressor" (poor-man's karaoke) in the options of with Ctrl+C (thanks to Matthias Keysermann)
- You can now use up to 8 microphones (thanks to Arjan Spieard)
- Startup errors are not silent anymore (you get an error dialog)
- Support for more controllers was added
- On dual-GPU systems we request the high-performance GPU

And some bugfixes:
- UTF-8 encoded files with BOM are handled correctly (in all text files)
- Fixed some OpenGL issues with shaders especially on Intel card
- Fixed font loading: Pango is now used on all platforms, so Performous should look the same everywhere
- More minor fixes (OS X build, clan build, fixes for crashes)

Under the hood we now support compiling with newer ffmpeg versions and switched from GLEW to libepoxy, which should make GL support a bit more robust across all hardware.

    <release version="1.0" date="2014-11-01" type="stable">
      <description>This release comes with some new features and quite a lot of changes "under the hood".
Most notable for user, we have a working Windows and OS X release again.
This brings Windows users all the cool features from the 0.7.0 release like duet-mode
and everything this release has to offer!
- We have a new song browser menu
- You can now build playlists, so you don't have to return to the songbrowser between songs!
- There is now experimental support for microphone pass-through, so you don't have to fiddle with ALSA or such stuff, just enable it in the settings and "enjoy" hearing your own voice through the speakers!
- The duet mode is better than ever, we fixed some corner cases and show microphone icons in duet menu, so you know which microphone has to sing which part before staring the song

Performous was changed to use SDL2 instead of SDL, which should give a much better experience with fullscreen among other things.
